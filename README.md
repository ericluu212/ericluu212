# Personal Website

This is a static personal website to showcase who I am and my work as a software engineer. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

- Edit `index.html` to update your information and projects.
- Customize styles in `css/styles.css`.
- Add interactivity in `js/main.js`.

## Deployment

To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new public repository on GitHub (e.g., `your-username.github.io`).
2. Push your code to the repository.
3. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages (set source to `main` branch or `/docs` folder).
4. Your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/`.
